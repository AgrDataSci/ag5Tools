## Get the CDS API-Key
To download AgERA5 data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) you should first register and get your
API Key from the [CDS API Guide](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to).

Once you have your API Key, you should create a file named ".cdsapirc". See more details at the
[CDS API Guide](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to)

You do not need to install Python or the 'CDASPI' client, ag5Tools will do it if required.

## Downloading AgERA5 data
The following example downloads variable "2m_temperature". For this variable there seven statistics available:  

* 24_hour_maximum

* 24_hour_mean

* 24_hour_minimum

* day_time_maximum

* day_time_mean

* night_time_mean

* night_time_minimum  

In this case, we will download "night_time_minimum". You should replace the target path to 
a location in your own computer where you want to store the downloaded data.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ag5Tools)

ag5_download(variable = "2m_temperature",
            statistic = "night_time_minimum",
            day = "all",
            month = "all",
            year = 2015,
            path = "C:/custom_target_folder")

```
